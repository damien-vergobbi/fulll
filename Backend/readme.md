## Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development

### Build

Create the executable `fleet` file at the root:
```bash
yarn build
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
yarn test
```

## Usage

### CLI Commands

```bash
./fleet create <userId> # returns fleetId on the standard output
./fleet register-vehicle <fleetId> <vehiclePlateNumber>
./fleet localize-vehicle <fleetId> <vehiclePlateNumber> lat lng [alt]
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# List all fleets and their vehicles with locations
./fleet list

# Clean database, executable and dist directory
yarn clean
```

## Architecture

This project follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) principles:

- `src/Domain/` - Domain models and interfaces
- `src/App/` - Application layer with commands and queries
- `src/Infra/` - Infrastructure layer with repositories

## Database

The system uses SQLite for persistence. The database file (`fleet.db`) is automatically created in the root directory.

## Step 3 - Code Quality & CI/CD

### Suggested Quality Tools

1. **ESLint** - Static code analysis
   - Catch potential errors and bugs
   - Enforce TypeScript best practices

2. **Prettier** - Code formatting
   - Consistent code style
   - Automated formatting

3. **Jest** - Unit testing
   - Complements Cucumber E2E tests
   - Code coverage reporting

### CI/CD Pipeline Propos√©

```yaml
# Main step
stages:
  - lint        # ESLint + Prettier
  - test        # Jest + Cucumber
  - security    # yarn audit
  - build       # Production build
  - deploy

# Automated actions
automation:
  - Run tests on each PR
  - Build on main branch
  - Generate coverage reports
  - Dependencies analysis
```
